The Drug regimen of Capomulin was effective in reducing the tumor volume in a mouse over a 45 day period by 35%. Continuing the study past 45 days could tell us the efficacy of Capomulin.

Both regimens had the lowest mean, and lowest Standard deviations. With a starting tumor volume of 45, only Capomulin and Ramicane reduced tumor volume after 45 days. Based on final tumor volume both Capomulin and Ramicane appeared to be equally effective.

There is a positive correlation between average tumor volume and weight within the subject mice at 0.84. But what does that mean? Correlation does not imply causation.

The study population was 51% / 49% male to female. Further analysis shows that Capomulin's population was 55.7% female and 44.3% male, while Ramicane's population was 67.5% male and 32.5% female. It would be worth further study to sex correlates to efficacy of these drug regimens.
